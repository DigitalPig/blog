## Introductions

If you apply for a loan or credit card and get declined, you surely want to know why. In order to get a loan next time, you may think of what is the number 1 area that I need to improve to get approval next time. If you build a financial forcast model that predicts macro-economical metrics and suddenly COVID-19 hits.

In the other word, sensitivity analysis provides the insights of model sensitivity to the fluctuation of model inputs.

There are many different methods to conduct sensitivity analysis. Here I want to show you one of them: Sobol Indices.
